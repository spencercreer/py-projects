#PROBLEM: Alice has some cards with numbers written on them. She arranges the cards in decreasing order, and lays them out face down in a sequence on a table. She challenges Bob to pick out the card containing a given number by turning over as few cards as possible. Write a function to help Bob locate the card.

def locate_card(cards, query):
    pass

tests = []
tests.append({
    'input' : {
        'cards': [13, 11, 10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 0],
        'query': 7
    },
    'output': 3
})

print(locate_card(**test['input']) == test['output'])
